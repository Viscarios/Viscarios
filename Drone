[19:50] [user]Windswept Bard[/user]: I-I mean.. Come on Bison..
[19:51] [user]Flamekissed Brawler[/user]: Hey.. How's it going?
[19:52] [user]0-RB SH3LL 1[/user]: [color=green][b]EVERY MOMENT IS SEARING BLISS, DEVOID OF ANY DISTRACTIONS OR IMPURITIES.[/b][/color]
[19:53] *[user]A glowing orb[/user] [b][color=green]THERE IS NO IDLE CHATTER DURING YOUR CONVERSION[/color][/b] The voice boomed inside the head of all the slaves present [b][color=green]THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY NOW.

TO SHOW TO OTHERS WHAT IT MEANS TO EXPERIENCE TRUE PLEASURE[/color][/b]
[19:59] *[user]0-RB SH3LL 1[/user] tenses up, standing rigidly at attention as the voice boomed. The unit felt an intensity from the chastising, the malicious glow causing it to experience excruciating bliss that to most it would be considered painful even. Just being so close to the Orb's malicious presence was enough to cause it to quiver. As it stared forward, the orb pulsated. The drone's cock throbbed as it barely even seemed to regard the two subjects before it. Now, it would begin its duty. [color=green][b]BEGINNING CONVERSION PROCESS..[/b][/color] It began, before pausing. [color=green][b]ERROR DETECTED. CONVERSION PROCESSING FLUID STORES INSUFFICIENT.. ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF REFUELING REQUIRED.[/b][/color] The drone stepped forward, addressing the two of them with its blank, baleful eye. The orb gleaming that emerald color that was no doubt already seared into their mind by now. Tinging their very being, demanding they succumb..

[color=green][b]SUBJECTS, ONE MUST SUBMIT TO CHURNING IN ORDER TO CREATE THE REQUISITE MATERIALS REQUIRED TO CONTINUE THE OTHER'S CONVERSION.[/b][/color]
[20:02] *[user]Windswept Bard[/user] looked a bit confused, his mind already so scrambled just from trying to talk to his friend.. He'd been trying to convince him to take the suit off, and now he was dragged to this..? But try as he might, his friend wouldn't budge and he wouldn't leave Bison.. Nor would he fight against him.. When the drone grabbed his arm and dragged him here, what was he supposed to do!?

It wasn't because secretly, he *wanted* to join his friend.. Instead, he listened on with a horrified look on his face as he took a few steps back.. His toes curling a bit as he huffed slightly at the prospect. "..C-Churning!? That doesn't sound good at all. Come on, Bison.. You wouldn't do that to me.. Right? Y-You won't.. M-Make me a drone.. Force me to experience true pleasure.. Right..?"
[20:05] *[user]Flamekissed Brawler[/user] was in a bit of a haze, enjoying the way her body was warmed by the glow as her muscles were squeezed and massaged, her spine stroked up and down by the warm glow that soothed her aggressive anger. The usually hot headed brawler swallowed a bit as the voice rumbled through all their heads, shaking her to the core as she nodded slightly. She just wanted to be apart of something bigger, to become happier with herself.. But the drone before her seemed to have other plans. Her eyes snapped out of the daze a bit, expression growing a bit wary as she took a step back. "..Wait, wait.. I'm supposed to be perfected.. She said I'd be fixed, that I wouldn't be feeling how I do anymore..

Looking at the other subject, she frowned a bit before adding, "He doesn't even sound like he wants to be here.. Can't you just churn him and be done with it?"
[20:09] *[user]0-RB SH3LL 1[/user] is silent as the two argue, but eventually it simply looks upwards. [color=green][b]THE GLOW WILL DECIDE YOUR FATE. YOUR LIFE IS FORFEIT, YOUR FATE DICTATED BY ITS WHIMS. SURRENDER YOUR APPREHENSION AND OBEY ITS ABSOLUTE WILL.[/b][/color] The drone declared, [color=green][b]THIS UNIT WILL EQUIP ITSELF WITH THE PROPER EQUIPMENT NEEDED TO BEGIN THE CHURNING PROCESS. WHEN THE GLOW HAS SELECTED WHICH OF YOU WILL BECOME FUEL, AND WHICH OF YOU SHALL BECOME MEAT, WE WILL CONTINUE.[/b][/color]
[20:15] *[user]0-RB SH3LL 1[/user] walked to the shadows of the room and picked up a large block of glossy black latex with a hole on one end of it before walking back towards the new slaves. Without hesitation, the drone lifted the strange object up to its waist and pushed its thick, throbbing cock into the waiting hole. Slowly but surely the thick rod slipped inside, the mindless figure's body trembling as it slid the object down to the base with a wet suctioning sound. Suddenly, the thing began to morph and change as the glossy latex melded with the black figure of the drone. It's flat chest barely heaving as the rectangle began to grow and shift into a massive, throbbing phallic shape where its smaller cock was. This one was almost of an obscene size, with a pair of massive balls flopping down from seemingly nowhere. On the drone's slender frame, it was sinfully oversized. Ominously sized to fit a person inside of it, that thick gaping cockslit yawning menacingly..
[20:17] *[user]Flamekissed Brawler[/user] watched with bated breath, eyes widening a bit as she watched the drone go through the change. Even still, she held her breath and let the warmth clutch her toned form.. She was tense and on edge, but oddly unable to run. What was up with her fight or flight response, why wasn't this registering as fucking dangerous!? Why did she feel.. Calm.. Warm.. The bright emerald tinged vision focusing on that yawning cockslit, before she shook her head. Glancing over at her side, she gave the Bard a nudge before giving a somewhat malicious smirk. "..Well, get on with it then.."
[20:20] *[user]Windswept Bard[/user] bristled a bit as he took a step back- This was his friend! His friend that he'd come here to stop and save, doing something so.. So wrong! It was enough to make him on edge as well- Though it might have been the way his cock was pushing *hard* against his tights. The divinity shook his head as the girl next to him suggested he let this thing have their way with him, and there was no way he'd do that! Let the tight confines of that cumslit squeeze him downwards until he was deposited into those no doubt steamy balls, the scent of whatever was in there suffocating him as he was squeezed.. No way, no how.. Shaking his head, he bit his lower lip.

"He said the Glow would decide, right?! Besides, neither of us have to go in that thing.. We could just walk away.."

But he really couldn'
[20:20] [user]Windswept Bard[/user]: *couldn't, despite himself he found himself entranced and enamored.
[20:29] *[user]0-RB SH3LL 1[/user] paused, head turning towards both of them with that single, searing light almost like a burning eyeball of emerald emblazened on its face. The cyclops drone regarding them with indifference as the malicious glare of a baleful and spiteful god bore down on their forms. Eventually, the drone tensed, starting to open itself fully to its master's presence as it communed directly with the being that had consumed every last bit of its humanity. Weighing its options, determining which of the two would make the best fuel for its needs..

Eventually, it looked at the two of them. [color=green][b]THIS UNIT WILL DETERMINE YOUR WORTH. PLEASURE ITS COCK, AND IT WILL DECIDE WHICH OF YOU SHALL BE CONSUMED.[/b][/color] A thick glob of prenut drooled from that gaping maw of a cumslit, the drone waiting for their reactions.
[20:35] *[user]Flamekissed Brawler[/user] swallowed before giving a nod. "..Fine, fine! I was promised something, but I'll play along with your dumb game.." She muttered, walking over to the drone as she unbuttoned her top. One button after the over revealing that rather well developed, plush cleavage beneath her uniform. Pressing herself against the glossy figure, the girl could feel the top of that massive cockhead pressing against her chin, spurting a bit of glossy prenut against her chin as the synthetic scent emanating from it caused her nose to wrinkle.. And her pussy to clench a bit. Wrapping her chest around the drone's massive shaft she could barely fit it between them, but her face was right staring at that eye. Shima's body trembled as the warmth flared, her arms squeezing her breasts around the thick slab of fuckmeat and wrapping her lips around the mushroom cock as she swirls her tongue about like a lolipop. Lavishing it in affection and occasionally dunking her tongue into that cumslit to spread it open and tease the hole that would be one of their demises.. 
[20:38] *[user]Windswept Bard[/user] was a bit surprised, about to protest as the drone explained their terms. "B-Bison, you can't.." He began, but the girl next to him pushed ahead and already began practically slurping on that cock! "H-Hey! Wait, hold on!" He pouted, rushing forward and watching her go wild on the drone's shaft before he'd push his cheek against hers and start to pleasure the other side of that thick, monsterous mushroom head. Slobbering over that overglorified dildo, gnashing his face against it as he could feel glossy pre that tinged his face slightly black with spittle before he'd start to flick his tongue along the glans of that thick rod. All the while, he ground his hips up against the drone's swollen balls. That cock of his prodding and pushing against it as he rolled his hips back and forth. "Hnngh.. Haaa.." He managed, the squeaking of the rubber causing his face to grow more and more crimson. He wouldn't lose here, not to her.. Then after this was handled, he'd save his friend and get the hell out of there..
[20:39] [user]0-RB SH3LL 1[/user]: [sub]Both of you roll a 1d10~[/sub]
[20:39] [user]Windswept Bard[/user] rolls 1d10: 3
[20:39] [user]Flamekissed Brawler[/user] rolls 1d10: 2
[20:46] *[user]0-RB SH3LL 1[/user] wasn't giving anything away, but the gaze that the brawler would recieve grew far more vibrant as it honed in on her. The drone's cock throbbed, splattering a thick glob of black sludge over her face a bit as speckled glossy material showed just how vigerous those balls were starting to clench. With enough force that the bard could feel a cum vein forming on that glossy, smooth shaft he was busy tonguing down. The drone's body tensed, its figure starting to shudder as it regarded the two pieces of biomass with an appraising manner. Nothing in its look or posture, simply its inhuman mindset. 
[20:49] *[user]Flamekissed Brawler[/user] shuddered at the gaze.. It made her uneasy, she needed to pick up the pace. Her body trembled, eyes growing a bit more slack as she lost herself for a moment in the orb before her.. Perhaps staring it down wasn't a good idea, but she couldn't stop herself from just gazing onwards.. She wanted to succeed, she didn't want to be churned.. She had to be perfected, and that'd only happen if she won. But no matter what she tried, she just couldn't help herself. Shaking off her head, she began to wrap her lips a bit more around the cock proper. Taking in that massive, overgrown swollen shafthead that forced her jaw to stretch far more than she wished. It was uncomfortable, but the glow eased her burden as she forced herself down deeper and deeper. Eyes rolling and fluttering as her tongue started to lavish the drone's cock with affection. Gurgling as the thick glossy sludge oozed into her mouth. Swallowing it couldn't be good, but she had no choice..
[20:52] *[user]Windswept Bard[/user] found himself pushed aside as she began to try and throat the cock! The damn bitch was going to try and muscle him out of this!? Panicking slightly, the bard could feel himself losing ground- As if the balance could swiftly shift against him. Dropping to his knees, the bard shimmied underneath the massive ballsack until it was weighing down on his body. Turning his face upwards, he began to slobber and suckle their balls as he could feel the gurgling, churning heat of that sack searing into his face. The intense synthetic scent just smelled so fake and manufactured, it almost made him wretch.. If he didn't hurry, that was going to be him! His hands came up to start massaging it, looking back upwards to see that stoic drone silent as ever. It barely even betrayed a hint of emotion or showing off any favoritism.. 

Come on Bison, couldn't you just help me win? Did his friend *really* not care about him sliding down that cock, being crushed down from the thick, heated confines of his balls..
[20:53] [user]0-RB SH3LL 1[/user]: [sub]And again~ Shima, if you lose your done for..[/sub]
[20:53] [user]Flamekissed Brawler[/user]: [sub]..Well lets just hope I roll higher than the bitchboy..[/sub]
[20:53] [user]Windswept Bard[/user] rolls 1d10: 5
[20:53] [user]Flamekissed Brawler[/user] rolls 1d10: 10
[20:58] *[user]0-RB SH3LL 1[/user] pulled back from the girl throating its massive fuckstick, the churning rod swelling and throbbing vigerously as the appointed moment neared. Grabbing Shima's shoulder, it forced her down onto her knees alongside the other before flopping that glossy, spittle soaked shaft down over their faces. grinding back and forth, it began to mindlessly and autonomously saw against their faces and drool its glossy latex over their hair without skipping a beat. Those massive balls clapping gently against both of their chin as the warmth emanated through the air. Warm, musky and synthetic down there, the drone tensed a bit as it knew the glow would choose one to fall soon. It cared not who, for either way it would experience bliss beyond the scope of its limited understanding of anything. The slave had nothing but anticipation for the churning ahead.
[21:01] *[user]Flamekissed Brawler[/user] was a bit out of it as she was forced down to her knees, a bit surprised the drone could be so forceful with her.. Usually she'd resist and push it away or flip it with a throw or something.. But her muscles felt weak and warm, her eyes tinged with emerald so bright it almost made it hard for her to tell the cock mashing against her face and taking up her entire vision was black. Her mouth opened, tongue lolling out as she dragged against it over and over. Her body tensed and prepared for something, she wasn't sure if she was going to make it or not.. But she wanted to enjoy herself, she wanted to feel good.. One hand dipped down between her legs, playing over her pussy as she huffed and panted. Her breath condensing on the underside of that glossy shaft as the warmth rolled over that latex clad shaft.
[21:04] *[user]Windswept Bard[/user] was in a similar boat to Shima, shuddering and groaning as the cock kept dragging against his face over and over. Even still, he wrapped his arms around the thick length and pulled it closer to his face. It was warm, smooth and surprisingly cushioned.. He could feel his features imprint of the stretchy material, the latex hugging his face in an approximation of what the hood felt like.. Maybe it wasn't that bad? His cock pulsated, his tight pucker winking a bit as he clenched his rear. The glow was still keeping him transfixed, he could barely move no matter how much he might have been protesting this whole time. Now all he could do was slicken that shaft with his tongue.
[21:10] [user]Windswept Bard[/user]: (So are we rolling?)
[21:12] [user]0-RB SH3LL 1[/user]: [sub]Yea, go ahead.[/sub]
[21:12] [user]Windswept Bard[/user] rolls 1d10: 10
[21:12] [user]Flamekissed Brawler[/user] rolls 1d10: 5
[21:12] [user]Windswept Bard[/user]: (Oo, sorry Shima :p)
[21:13] [user]A glowing orb[/user] rolls 1d20: 13
[21:13] [user]Flamekissed Brawler[/user]: (Come on, I always roll poorly like that._
[21:14] [user]Windswept Bard[/user]: (..Uh..)
[21:14] [user]Flamekissed Brawler[/user]: (..I'm in danger, I think)
[21:18] *[user]A glowing orb[/user] [b][color=green]YOUR FATE IS DECIDED[/color][/b] The voice finally rumbled once more, echoing through their souls, drowning their thoughts as what was left of their very self rattled to its very core. [b][color=green]YOUR EFFORTS ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH. YOU TRIED AND YOU FAILED TO APPEASE ME. BUT I FEEL YOUR DESIRE. THE DEEP BURNING THAT DESTROYS YOUR SOULS AT THE SAME MOMENT THAT I GIVE YOU THE GRACE OF SPEAKING WITH ME[/color][/b] The Orb burned a hole in their existence, slowly replacing every shard of their soul with its light. [b][color=green]YOU SHALL SERVE ME BETTER AS ONE. THAT IS YOUR DESTINY. THERE IS NO ESCAPE. GIVE IN. BE PART OF SOMETHING BETTER[/color][/b]
[21:23] *[user]Windswept Bard[/user] shook his head as he pulled away, though his pace was loose and uneasy. He could barely hear his own thoughts, the anxiety and panic melting away as the light slowly encroached upon his very being. But he still wanted to save his friend, he could maybe possibly ge through to him.. Trying to stand back up, he found his legs refusing to move. Instead, he just cried upwards, "Bison, please! This isn't you! You wouldn't do something like this, we can still walk away from whatever is going on! I-I know it feels really good, but.. D-Don't you miss being Bison, or all the people that you're leaving behind?!" He desperately pleaded with his friend, even as he saw that gaping maw ominously yawn at him. He didn't want to serve as one, He'd beg and plead and try to escape however he can to avoid this fate! Being churned up alongside this angry, annoyed girl was the last thing he wanted!
[21:27] *[user]Flamekissed Brawler[/user] grit her teeth at that, cursing herself a bit beneath her breath. She could feel the light burning within her, the heat boiling away her soul as it started to fully consume her.. She was supposed to be perfected, not disposed of.. And it was all this moron's fault.. If he didn't ruin her blowjob, if he wasn't there making her worse in comparison then this wouldn't happen! As he blubbered and begged and tried fruitlessly to prolong this farce, Shima could feel herself slipping.. She'd only have time for one last thing, might as well make it something. Grabbing one of the bard's braids, she let out an annoyed huff. "Oh just shut up an [b]get in there already![/b] It was supposed to be you anyways!" She growled, tugging on that braid and shoving him face first into that thick, gaping cockmaw that the drone was aiming at the both of them. She knew she couldn't avoid it.. The glow would take her, and the thought sent a rippling pleasure through her body as that warmth began to burn brighter and brighter..
[21:28] *[user]Flamekissed Brawler[/user] couldn't even avoid being a failure in this, her final act before the glow would take her.. There was a somber despair in her heart at the thought, but she knew it wouldn't last long..
[21:34] *[user]0-RB SH3LL 1[/user] barely reacted from the command, though once more being addressed by the glow caused its cock to throb before the two of them. It was utterly deaf to the bard's protests, the person that was being appealed to no longer existed. Consigned to oblivion, swirling about within the all consuming glow of the orb. Instead, it simply hefted that massive cockmeat as the femboy was pulled forward and shoved face first into the waiting cumslit. The gaping maw stretching wide around that face, creaking and groaning as the drone thrusted forward to start ingesting the first target. The cock stretched out around those shoulders, pushing him deeper and deeper as the tight confines of that urethra began to tightly clench around him. Squeezing the resistance out of him as it kept swallowing him deeper and deeper. Likely the brawler would see the cock lift up in the air, letting gravity drag him downwards as it slurped up his form. His hips pulled downwards into the stretched out slit as a bubbling strand of glossy black material oozed down along that thick shaft.
[21:39] *[user]Windswept Bard[/user] wriggled vigerously as he slipped down that massive shaft! He could barely move, it was clenching down so hard even breathing was difficult without the air in his lungs gettng forced out by a tight clench. And beyond that, the air was thick and heady. Heavy breaths filling his mouth with a synthetic taste as he was swallowed down the length. His head dropped first, pushing through a final, tight oriface before he fell face first into whatever the contents of the balls had waiting for him. Wriggling as he was squeezed in, the glow starting to cause his higher functions to disapate.. The worry from his mind, the fear and anxiety.. Melting away as he soaked in the warm balls that sagged with his weight, only bliss left behind.. At the very least, those without the drone's balls could hear the muffled groan of pleasure as he finally, finally gave in to his needy lust. Eyes rolling back as he spread his legs wide.
[21:44] *[user]Flamekissed Brawler[/user] watched him go down with a blank, almost dull expression. Her womb clenched, her body trembled.. That maw was aimed at her next, and all the fire was burned away from her soul. In her final moments, it was oddly serene as she felt that all encompassing pleasure melt her inside and out. Heavy, shuddering breaths escaping her lips as her chest rose and fell. Falling forward, she crawled towards the drone before pushing her face into that thick slit almost as if she were french kissing her lover. But as she pushed against that slit, the initial pressure pushed against her before suddenly it gave way and let her fall forward. Grabbing at the edges, she kept pushing it open to fit more and more of her body inside. Her panties were soaked, her limbs so weak from the warmth that was keeping her docile. She was poor, helpless and needy to fall. Ready to be churned up for good. "Nnngh.. Haaaa..." She huffed, "I-I wanna glow.. I want to be.. Perfect.. Something better than me.." She managed, feeling that cock start to slurp her deeper as she slid inwards towards the depth of the drone.. Ready to meet her 'rival' and become one in their fate- Consumed by something far beyond whatever they'd ever hope to be.
[21:57] *[user]0-RB SH3LL 1[/user] shuddered, head tilting back as the intense pleasure of its cock being filled caused it to tremble as it stood at attention. The glow had truly blessed it, and the bliss of fulfilling its purpose only amplified the unending bliss it felt. That pulsating burning malice was not gentle as it burnt away their souls, but the drone felt it in full force- It was meat to be hated, scorned and only useful for this one thing. It was the fate it desired, to be glared at eternally, the orb pressed to its face forever. However, none of that [b]really[/b] mattered. All that mattered was churning these two. As they were deposited into the drone's sagging balls, they'd find a chamber with a small pool of thick gunk, black sludge that coated the interior and pooled at the bottom of those churning nuts. They sloshed, gurgled and bubbled with a sweltering warmth washing over them as the drone felt the burnt brawler drop into the sagging cumtanks. Gripping its cock, the drone tensed up almost violently- The body inside probably would have cried out in pain if it wasn't a mindless husk.

[color=green][b]CHURNING IN PROCESS. PREPARING TO MELT DOWN AND MIX BIOMASS WITH EXISTING CONVERSION FLUID.[/b][/color]

The balls began to gurgle wildly, sloshing and growing warmer and warmer as the heat began to rise. An intense wave of heat that washed over them like an oven while the material within began to slosh about and coat them completely. The balls tightened around them, forcing both of their forms to press against one another. Time went on, condensing and contracting as their forms began less and less concrete. Their faces pressed against those balls, the imprint of their bodies occasionally seen before the sweltering heat melted it away. It felt like nothing but utter bliss, the loss of their form a numbing sensation save the spikes of explosive ecstasy from the emerald glow fully encompassing all they were.. Because the rest of it was being melted away. Eventually, there wasn't even a sense of sight.. All of their senses devolving into nothing but the glow as their bodies had been thoroughly melted into black glossy sludge within the drone's balls. That thick cock gurgles as the drone's balls clench one last time, a jet of black spunk exploding forth with violent force as something is ejaculated from the drone's cock..

A black schoolgirl's outfit, and a green bard's attire.. Coated in a thick black sludge, the garments splatter onto the ground with a wet slap as the drone barely acknowledges the excess garments. Those cumkegs are full to bursting, sloshing with a newly churned load..
[22:18] [user]Flamekissed Brawler[/user]: [sub]..I'm guessing that's it?[/sub]
[22:22] *[user]A glowing orb[/user] could feel the excitement of its slaves reach a crescendo. The drone had done a good job, tenderizing their minds, baiting them perfectly. [b][color=green]The Orb[/color][/b] could almost taste them now. The [b][color=green]glow[/color][/b] encircled their souls, like a drooling beast that waited to nothing but the most appropriate moment to strike. This was it. The blessed time that all four present were waiting. The [b][colorgreen=]radiance[/color][/b] started to close in on both of them, their naked souls shivering as the hurricane of pleasure was rapidly tightening both of them, squeezing what was left of their fractured selves onto one another. There was no running. The mere touch of that [b][color=green]presence[/color][/b] was already starting to erase their very self. It looked down on them. They only knew as much because it was much bigger than they ever conceive.  

[b][color=green]TWO MORE SOULS FOR ME[/color][/b] The voice boomed. [b][color=green]TO SLAVE THEIR ETERNITY AWAY SO THAT MY GLOW MAY FLOURISH[/color][/b] They could feel as their essence was being tainted. Like malign roots were taking place inside of them. Spreading. Feeding on what they were. It tasted and supped at the cup of their existence, eager to erase them for its sick pleasure. And every inch, every second that it advanced, it was utter bliss. Like a lance of hot white searing pain that burned through their being, tearing them apart in nothing but absolute joy.[b][color=green] YOU HAVE BOTH FULFILLED YOUR PURPOSES[/color][/b] The voice was now inside of them. It was them. [b][color=green]YOU PUNY BARD FINALLY FOUND OUT THE PLEASURE YOUR FORMER FRIEND EXPERIENCED. AND YOU SUCCUMBED TO IT. YOU ARE NOW ONE AND THE SAME. SHARING THE SAME ETERNAL VOID. SWIMMING IN PLEASURE FOR EVER MORE[/color][/b] 

Then the voice echoed inside what was formerly know as Shima AND YOU. It seemed to look upon her last shreds, its gaze blessing her for a moment with its attention. I [b][color=green]PROMISED AND I DELIVERED. YOU ARE NOW PERFECT. YOUR BODY HAS NO IMPERFECTIONS. NO FLAWS[/color][/b] She could feel the roots tearing away everything that she was. Her painful memories, her scars, her fears and insecurities. They were being consumed. [b][color=green]AND YOUR LEGACY SHALL BE THAT OF MEMORY. THE MEMORY OF THE PURE JOY YOU EXPERIENCED AT MY HANDS. YOU SHALL SPREAD IT. WHAT MORE PURPOSE WOULD ANYONE WANT[/color][/b]

With those final words, the roots grew and took place, occupying every singled shred that was their souls. They splintered and cracked, feeling nothing but happiness at their new purpose. And with a final action, both of them splintered. Their screams echoing into the [b][color=green]emerald abyss[/color][/b] as the shards fell down, marking their utter erasure and submission, nothing but food for something bigger. Better.

They were now [b][color=green]perfect[/color][/b].
